### Prerequisites

Before running the applications, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Install npm

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands:
    ```
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
3. If Node.js and npm are not installed, follow the installation instructions provided on the Node.js website.

### Step 2: Run Client and Server

1. **Client:**
    - Navigate to the client directory in your terminal:
        ```
        cd path/to/client
        ```
    - Install dependencies:
        ```
        npm install
        ```
    - Start the client application:
        ```
        npm start
        ```
    - The client application should now be running. You can access it through your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Server:**
    - Open a new terminal window or tab.
    - Navigate to the server directory:
        ```
        cd path/to/server
        ```
    - Install dependencies:
        ```
        npm install
        ```
    - Start the server:
        ```
        npm start
        ```
    - The server should now be running and ready to accept requests.

### Running npm
